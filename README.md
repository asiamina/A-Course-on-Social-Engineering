# Instructional Materials for the Social Engineering Course
## Texas Tech University, A joint effort between the 1) Computer Science Department, and 2) Department of Psychological Sciences
## Designed and Taught by: 1) Dr. Akbar Namin (Computer Science Department), and 2) Dr. Keith S. Jones (Department of Psychological Sciences)
###### A course on "Digital Forensics" designed and offered as a cross-listed course at Texas Tech University 2020


This repository contains the instructional modules and course materials to teach Social Engineering. the materials are developed by:

1. [Dr. Akbar Namin](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/faculty/akbar_siami-namin/index.php), Associate Professor of [Computer Science](http://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/) at [Texas Tech University](http://www.ttu.edu/) 
2. [Dr. Keith S. Jones](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/psy/people/kjones/), Associate Professor of [Psychological Sciences](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/psy/) at [Texas Tech University](http://www.ttu.edu/) 

The materials were prepared, developed, taught during 2020, and it is evolving. This course initiallay is developed as a cross-listed graduate-level university course. But it can also be used for undergraduate students. The lecture notes were prepared by the insturctors of the course, the lab and hands-on experiences were developed by the graduate assistants working on this research.

## About the Course
TBD. 

This course introduces the basic concepts and techniques usually employed in social engineering attacks and analysis. The contents are primarily divided into four major topics: 

1. Topic 1
2. Topic 2
3. Topic 3
4. Topic 4

These four topics constitute the skeleton of social engineering techniques and practices. T 

The course is completely practical supported with hands-on experiences and formal lectures. Students taking this course will be able to:
*	Demonstrate in-depth knowledge of social engineering basics
* Understand the basic techniques of conducting social engineering attacks
* TBD.
*	

The tentative topics and tools to be covered include:

*	TBD
* TBD

## Learning Outcomes
The following are the expected  learning  outcomes  of the course:
* Masters  of Science Degree:
1. Communicate effectively orally and in writing  (LO 1) 
2. Engage in life-long learning and self-critique  (LO 2)
3. Function independently on self-directed projects or research where appropriate (LO 4 )
* Doctor  of Philosophy  Degree:
1. Graduates are expected  to communicate effectively orally and in writing  (LO 1 ) 
2. Engage in life-long learning  and self-critique  (LO 2 ).
3. Function in a multi-disciplinary, and culturally diverse environment with cross-functional teams (LO 3)

## Textbooks

There are four sections, each would require a separate textbook. Here is the list of books used for each section:

1. TBD
* Book: TBD 
* Author: TBD
* Published Year: TBD
* Publisher: TBD

## Additional Textbooks

5. TBD.
6. TBD.

## Additional References

TBD

## Course Team-based Project

To stimulate learning, four team and **competition**-based projects are defined.  The four projects will allow students and each team practice the necessary skillsets for each section (i.e., reverse engineering, etc.). For each project, each team plays the role of both blue and red teams and thus is responsible to build an artifact with some secret item that will be discovered by the other team. 

For instance, in disk forensics, each team will create a disk dump file with some hidden secret recipes hiden in different sectors, and the other team's job is to discover the secret recipes. 

## Students Evaluation

Students will be graded based on assignments, exams, and the project (tentative).
*	Assignments (four individual assignments): 40%
*	Projects (four team-based projects): 40% 
*	Take Home Exams: 20%
